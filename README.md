# AI-Symptom-Checker
Overview
The AI-Powered Symptom Checker is a web application designed to analyze user-reported symptoms and provide potential disease predictions along with recommendations for further action. By leveraging K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithms, this tool aims to enhance health literacy, improve user experience, and promote timely healthcare interventions.

Features
Symptom Analysis: Users can input symptoms to receive a preliminary analysis and potential disease predictions.
Predictive Analytics: The system forecasts potential health issues based on historical trends in user symptoms and behaviors.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface allows users to interact with the symptom checker easily.
Real-Time Monitoring: Users can track their symptoms over time and receive alerts for concerning trends.
Educational Resources: Provides information about symptoms and associated health conditions to improve health literacy.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages:

Python: Backend logic and machine learning model implementation.
JavaScript: Front-end interactivity.
HTML/CSS: User interface development.
Framework:

Flask: Web framework for managing backend and APIs.
Machine Learning:

Scikit-learn: Library used for implementing the KNN algorithm.
Data Storage:

Cloudant: NoSQL database for storing user consultations and symptom data.
Libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.
Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model.
